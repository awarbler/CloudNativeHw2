# CloudNativeHw2

This repository contains a multi-part web development project demonstrating core web and React development skills, version control practices, and deployment with GitHub Pages. The work is organized as a progressive learning series, moving from static HTML/CSS to interactive React applications.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Clean, standards-based HTML and CSS
- Responsive layout and accessibility-aware design
- Modern front-end development with React
- Practical use of Git and GitHub for version control
- Real-world deployment via GitHub Pages

# Project Components

### **Task 1 — Static One-Page Website (HTML/CSS)**
**Location:** `/docs`

This is a responsive, single-page personal portfolio site built using only HTML and CSS. It demonstrates:

- Semantic HTML structure
- External stylesheet usage
- Use of IDs and classes for styling
- Responsive layout principles
- Accessible navigation with anchor links
- Image optimization with alt text
- Consistent typography and spacing
- GitHub Pages deployment

Key files:
- `docs/index.html`
- `docs/stylesheet.css`

### **Task 2 — React Tic-Tac-Toe Application**
**Location:** `Task2_React_TicTacToe/`

A React implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the official React tutorial. This project demonstrates:

- Functional React components  
- State management with `useState`  
- Component composition  
- Event handling  
- Conditional rendering  

### **Task 3 — React Projects Page (In Progress)**
**Location:** `Task3_React_Project/`

A React-based projects dashboard that will showcase multiple projects using reusable components, props, and state management.

Planned features include:
- Project cards component  
- Dynamic rendering from data  
- Event handling  
- Modular component structure  

# GitHub Pages Configuration

GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from:

- **Branch:** `main`  
- **Folder:** `/docs`

Any changes pushed to files inside `/docs` will automatically update the live site.


# What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Structuring clean, readable HTML  
- Writing maintainable CSS  
- Using Git for version control and collaboration  
- Deploying a website with GitHub Pages  
- Understanding the transition from static sites to React applications  

## Future Work

Planned improvements include:
- Refining the visual design of the static site  
- Adding a “Back to Top” button for better navigation  
- Completing the React Projects page  
- Improving accessibility (ARIA labels, contrast, semantics)  
- Adding unit tests for React components
